  <img src="your-image-url.jpg" alt="Your Name" class="profile-picture">
  <p>Hi, I'm Nezar Khabiry, a positive and focused student with a strong background in computer science and information analytics. Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Science with a concentration on Information Analytics and a minor in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina Greensboro (UNCG), with an expected graduation date in 2025. I am skilled in various programming languages and platforms, including Java, Python, Rust, and R, and have experience with AWS cloud-based solutions and SQL.</p>
  <p>I am passionate about helping and talking to people, and I am always curious and determined to learn new things. I am driven by passion and dedicate myself to activities and projects that truly matter to me. Over the past three years, I have embarked on a journey to explore my identity through a critical lens.</p>
  <p>Throughout my academic and professional life, I have consistently gone above and beyond expectations. I have completed over 100 cumulative hours of community service, showcasing my dedication to helping others and making a positive impact. As a highly adaptable individual, I am capable of learning new technologies quickly and working well with diverse groups.</p>
  <p>With my diverse skill set and passion for helping others, I believe I can make a significant contribution to any organization or research project that I am involved in. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.</p>
