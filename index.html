<!-- Research Paper -->
<section id="Research Abstract">
  <h2>Research Abstract</h2>
   <p>In this article, the author attempts to understand the characteristics of individuation and the context behind what defines someone's gender expression. Research suggests that the factors are broad and dependent on the experience of the authentic self. This work supports the response to 'An alternative perspective: gender expression is a form of individuation and authentic self' by Karen Herdzik (2021).</p>
  <p>This exploration draws evidence from literature and surveys, analyzing responses from a college demographic. The aim is to provide background information on the broad consensus of why people attempt to conform to societal norms. The author's motivation for this research is self-exploration, as a non-binary individual. Some have attempted to cite psychological distress as a driving factor for conformity (Withers, 2020). However, this paper attempts to draw evidence for Herdzik's definition of gender, which posits that it exists as a form of individuation. To provide a point of cross-examination, a literary analysis of how people see themselves will be conducted using gathered data. This will include a look into self-identified involuntary celibates or "incels", as described by Daly and Reed (2019), in order to show how different interpretations of gender exist in hegemonic structures. This exploration may reveal a new way to interpret gender.</p>

<section id="Methods">
  <h2>Methods:Quantitative and Qualitative</h2>
  <p>To gauge the complexity and diversity of perspectives, we chose to gather information through two surveys. We sent out both surveys to a college demographic and posted them online to broaden the respondent base. 
   The first survey was titled &quot;Gauging Support for Withers, R. (2020): Transgender Medicalization and the Attempt to Evade Psychological Distress.&quot; 
   The questions were formulated based on the claims brought up in response to Withers or by Withers. We developed the questions around the Likert scale to enable numeric analysis.
   The Likert scale gages the individual&apos;s reaction/ feeling towards a topic. &nbsp;It&apos;s important to note that these questions have come under scrutiny due to their insensitive/biased wording, which does not reflect the conclusion or methodology found in respect to Withers.
   The second survey was designed with more open interpretations in mind to understand how individuals define what gender is and isn&apos;t.
   It was titled &quot;Gender Diversity in a Broader Context: What Does Gender Mean to You?&quot; Both surveys will be analyzed quantitatively with statistical analysis in R, while being analyzed qualitatively and compared and contrasted with the literature.
   We will make a broad attempt to highlight trends and identify any problematic data gathered.</p>
