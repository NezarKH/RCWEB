       <h2>Survey #1: Gaging support for Withers, R. (2020). Transgender medicalization and the attempt to evade psychological distress</h2>

<p>
    <strong>1.</strong> Being born a specific sex, it be man/woman/intersex, gives inherent disadvantages/advantages in society.<br>
    <strong>2.</strong> In an isolated environment, without societal influence, how would that affect your gender/way you identify?<br>
    <strong>3.</strong> Gender is a representation of the authentic self. Do you agree that people become what they identify with, regardless of what sex they are assigned?<br>
    <strong>4.</strong> Do you blame your assigned sex for the way society has treated you?<br>
    <strong>5.</strong> I feel pressured to conform to society's gender definition; if I didn't, it would cause me distress.<br>
    <strong>6.</strong> If someone's gender expression is dictated by the world around them, then it isn't their gender expression, but an attempt to conform.<br>
    <strong>7.</strong> Do you agree that gender is subjective? Any objective analysis that is reliant on rigid definitions fails to properly understand gender.<br>
    <strong>8.</strong> At points of distress, I had wished that people saw my gender differently.<br>
    <strong>9.</strong> Have you ever used the "social privilege" of being born a specific sex to influence the world/people around you?<br>
    <strong>10.</strong> Hypothetically, if being a specific gender gives you social advantages, would you become that gender, regardless of your own internal desires?<br>
    <strong>11.</strong> If your gender fails to represent your authentic self, would it be valid? Would it even be you?<br>
    <strong>12.</strong> Do you agree that transitioning could serve as an escape from social problems?<br>
    <strong>13.</strong> Defining my gender for myself should serve as the first step of questioning its validity.<br>
    <strong>14.</strong> The cause of gender dysphoria isn't strictly relegated to people of transgender experience.<br>
    <strong>15.</strong> To truly know your gender, you must embark on a journey of self-individuation. Only then can you be certain that your gender is valid.

            <h2>Data and Analysis for Survey #1</h2>
         
            <p>In our analysis of Survey #1, we found that the average age of respondents was 22.57, with a majority being assigned female at birth (73.7%).
             Existing research supports the idea that being born a specific sex corresponds with societal disadvantages or advantages. 
             A significant portion (40%) of respondents were neutral about whether an isolated environment would impact self-perception of gender. 
             The null hypothesis that isolated environments do not impact self-perception of gender was not rejected, but the correlation was weak and dependent on one's lived experience. 
             These findings contribute to the ongoing conversation about the influence of societal factors on gender identity and expression.</p>
         
         <section>
  <h2>Exploring Opinions and Perspectives on Gender</h2>
  <p>There is a wide range of opinions on whether being born a specific sex gives inherent advantages or disadvantages in society. Responses varied from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). This indicates that people have diverse perspectives on the impact of sex on societal opportunities and challenges.</p>

  <p>Many respondents seem to agree that in an isolated environment without societal influence, their gender or way of identification would be different (responses are mostly in the 3 to 5 range).</p>

  <p>A significant number of respondents agree that gender is a representation of the authentic self, and people become what they identify as, regardless of their assigned sex (responses mostly in the range of 3 to 5).</p>

  <p>When asked if they blame their assigned sex for the way society has treated them, responses are varied, suggesting that some people may feel that their assigned sex has negatively impacted their experiences, while others may not attribute societal treatment to their sex.</p>

  <p>Most respondents feel pressured to conform to society's gender definitions (responses are mostly in the range of 4 to 5).</p>

  <p>There is strong agreement that gender is subjective, and objective analysis that relies on rigid definitions fails to properly understand gender (responses mostly in the range of 4 to 5).</p>

  <p>Responses vary on whether transitioning could serve as an escape from social problems, suggesting that people's opinions on this matter are diverse.</p>

  <p>Most respondents believe that defining their gender for themselves should be the first step in questioning its validity (responses are mostly in the range of 4 to 5).</p>

  <p>A majority of respondents felt that the questions made them look at gender from a different perspective (responses are mostly in the range of 4 to 5).</p>

  <p>Many respondents believe there is significant misinformation about gender out there (responses mostly in the range of 4 to 5).</p>
